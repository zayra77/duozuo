he raw data of breast cancer patients is a file named "data_raw_0416".

The raw data of breast cancer patients after preprocess is a file named "data_befilled_0416".

Data Preprocessing:
For patient information, we converted “patients over 46 years old” to 1 and “patients ≤ 46 years old” to 0. For groups of patients with breast cancer (BC), we converted “patients with BC recurrence” to 1 and “patients with no recurrence” to 0. The "Group" is "分组" in the file named "data_befilled_0416". We converted “patients with menopause” to 1 and “patients with no menopause” to 0; We converted “patients with primary cancer in the left breast” to 1 and “patients with primary cancer in the right breast” to 2; We converted “patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of BC” to 1, “patient with other types of invasive carcinoma” to 0, and “patients with unknown histological types of BC” to 2; We converted “patient with tumor size ≤ 2 cm, T1” to 0, “patients with tumor size > 2 cm and ≤5 cm, T2” to 1, “patients with tumor size > 5 cm, T3” to 2, “patients with unknown tumor size” to 3; We converted “patient with lymph node staging 0 (N0)” to 0, “patient with lymph node staging 1 (N1)” to 1, “patient with lymph node staging 2 (N2)” to 2, and “patient with lymph node staging 3 (N3)” to 3; We converted “patient with unknown of histological grade” to 0, “patient with more well-differentiated histological grade” to 1, “patient with moderately differentiated histological grade” to 2, and “patient with more poorly differentiated histological grade” to 3 and “patient with undifferentiated histological grade” to 4; We converted “patient with HER2-positive of molecular subtype” to 1, “patient with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)” to 2, “patient with Luminal A of molecular subtype” to 3, “patient with Luminal B HER2- negative of molecular subtype” to 4, “patient with Luminal B HER2-positive of molecular subtype” to 5, and “patient with unknown of molecular subtype” to 6; We converted “patient with breast conserving therapy” to 0, “patient with mastectomy” to 1, “patient with chemotherapy” to 2, and “patient with unknown treatment strategies” to 3. The missing value imputation on missing at random data of FⅧ using multiple imputation by R package (a file named "mice.R"). The missing value imputation on missing at random data of α2-AP using random forest by Python package (a file named "fill_nan.py").

Eleven Machine Learning Models were developed and validated by a file named "model.py" and a file named "ROC_polt.py".

The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) analysis and visualization were performed by the file named "ROC_polt.py".

The decision curve analysis (DCA) and visualization were performed by a file named "DCA_plot.py" and a file named "plot_fun.py".
